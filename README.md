### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I like to code. I developed an interest in programming through games. I started coding when commercial engines like unity or unreal either didn't exist or weren't available to the public so I primarily used C/C++. These days I have shifted to Rust because it has a proper module system, a cleaner type system, and its much easier to redistribute source. I'm specifically writing libraries/software that target webassembly because I believe it can allow developers to reach more people. The ability for users to reach your code through a click of a hyperlink has obvious benefits.

Also I used to write toy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thecoast47/videos"> physics simulations in c++ </a> a lot when I was a teen.

Note: I hate larpers on /g/. Invest in rope.
